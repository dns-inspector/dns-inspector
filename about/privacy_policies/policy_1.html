            <h2>Policy Details</h2>
            <p>This policy applies to the DNS Inspector software ("the app"). DNS Inspector is a tool designed for
                network and systems administrators to test & validate DNS configurations quickly and easily.</p>
            <p>We take extreme care & great pride in enshrining your privacy, this document describes what information
                is provided when you use the app and how the app uses that information.</p>
            <h3>Information You Provide the App</h3>
            <h4>DNS Query & Server</h4>
            <p>When you use the app, you provide a DNS query to perform. This query includes a DNS record type and DNS
                name. The app will then connect to the target DNS server to perform the query and collect the results.
                Like all internet connections, this will include the IP address of your device or your network, which
                can also infer an approximate geographical location.</p>
            <div class="notice notice-info">
                <span class="title">Important</span>
                <span class="body">It's important that you use a DNS server that you trust and have reviewed their
                    privacy policy. Some DNS Servers are configured to keep records of queries sent to them; a practice
                    known as “logging”. This is outside of what DNS Inspector can control.</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Recent Queries</h4>
            <p>By default, the app will store the last 5 queries on your device. This list is saved locally to your
                device and is not synchronized with any internet service. You can remove individual hosts from this list
                or disable this feature entirely from within the app.</p>
            <h4>Application Logs</h4>
            <p>The app records information related to the operation of the app in text files, known as "logs", on your
                device. During normal operation of the app, these logs only contain information about errors. Details
                about your DNS queries are not recorded. If you are experiencing problems using DNS Inspector, we may
                ask that you increase the verbosity of these logs by turning on "Debug Logging". When this setting is
                enabled, detailed information about your DNS queries are recorded. These log files are stored locally on
                your device and are never shared with anybody without your explicit action & consent.</p>
            <h3>Information You Provide Us</h3>
            <p>In normal use of the app, you do not provide any information to us. You may choose to contact the DNS
                Inspector team using E-Mail through links provided in the app or on this website. This is entirely
                optional and is subject to the normal privacy expectations with sending E-Mail messages.</p>
